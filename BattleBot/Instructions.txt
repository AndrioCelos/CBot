- Concept
	Battle Arena is a new mIRC game, inspired by Devil May Cry. Players must enter the Arena and battle monsters from various games, anime and stories.
	There is a multitude of weapons available in the game. Each weapon allows the wielder to use a number of special techniques to wage battle.
	To earn weapons, techniques and other things, you need to collect Red and Black Orbs by defeating monsters.
- Shop
		As a new character, you're not quite ready to battle the monsters yet. You'll need to pay a visit to the shop and buy a few upgrades.
		[*] Use !shop to start checking out the shop.

- Basics
		Keep an eye on that portal. When it opens...
	[Opens a battle.]
		...monsters are preparing to arrive to the battlefield! Players will now assemble to defeat the monsters.
	[Enters the battle.]
	[The battle begins.]
	[Waits for own turn.]
		The flow of battle is turn-based. On your turn, you have a number of options.
		To start, let's perform a standard attack with our weapons.
	[Performs a standard attack.]
	[Waits for guest's turn.]
		Now it's your turn.
		[*] Use /me attacks <monster> to do a standard attack!
		Good job.
		Notice that your attack did some damage to the monster, reducing its health. When its health reaches zero, it is defeated and you win the battle.
		Another thing you can do in your turn is taunt. This adds to your style rating.
		[*] use /me taunts <monster> to taunt it!
		Nice one. Now, keep attacking to defeat the monster!
