Version 0.1 â€“ 2 January 2015
----------------------------

* Ported to C# for The Great Rewrite
* New dice have been introduced, with symbols that make more sense. The old ones were based on a (PC) game with graphics that can't be recreated on IRC.
* **Fix:** Players quitting the game will no longer put the plugin into an unplayable state.
